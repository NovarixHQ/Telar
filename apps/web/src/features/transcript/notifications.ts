/**
 * WHAT HAPPENED, DECIDED ONCE — issue #572.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO END ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A worker sent its coordinator a `result` and its turn ended a few seconds
 * later. Those are two facts and #240 keeps them two on purpose — but both rows
 * read "Session finished a turn", because the surface drawing the peer's message
 * classified it as a wake. One duplicated line, and a coordinator that had been
 * told two different things could not see either.
 *
 * ── SO THE CLASSIFICATION IS ONE FUNCTION ───────────────────────────────────
 * `notificationVerbs` is the only place that turns a happening into a word.
 * `notificationLabel` (the transcript row, the cockpit's turn header, a wake
 * that landed mid-turn) derives from it, so there is no second switch to forget
 * a new intent in.
 *
 * ── HERE RATHER THAN IN `transcript.tsx` ────────────────────────────────────
 * The verbs used to live beside the component that drew them. A pure module
 * has no direction to be wrong about, and the table is testable on its own.
