/**
 * WHAT A ROW SAYS ABOUT ITS TERMINALS — issue #883.
 *
 * A settled row still holding terminals wears a count, explained on hover, and
 * its hover actions carry the way to close them. An active row's Settle says
 * how many it will close, and nothing more when there are none. Every case
 * starts from a `LiveSessionRow` parsed by the protocol and a count taken off
 * the live read's `terminals` map, through `toSidebarSession`, as the rail does.
