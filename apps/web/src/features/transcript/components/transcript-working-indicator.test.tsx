/**
 * #431 — A COMPACTION IS NOT A STALL.
 *
 * The working indicator turns amber with "· no output Ns" after twenty seconds
 * of silence, which is the one readout that distinguishes a slow turn from a
 * stuck one. A context compaction emits nothing by construction and routinely
 * runs past thirty seconds, so it tripped the warning EVERY time — the session
 * read as hung at exactly the moment the provider was doing the most necessary
 * thing it does.
 *
 * These render the indicator the way `session-cockpit` does — label and
 * `delegated` from `turnActivity`, `compacting` from `isCompacting` — so what is
 * asserted is the wiring and not just the prop.
 *
 * THE INDICATOR OWNS ITS CLOCK (#498), so "now" is no longer a prop these can
 * set. It seeds from `Date.now()` on its first render, which is what the stub
 * below pins: the turn started a minute before whatever the component reads.
