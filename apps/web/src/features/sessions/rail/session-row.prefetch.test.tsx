/**
 * #497 — WHEN A RAIL ROW OPENS ITSELF AHEAD OF THE CLICK.
 *
 * MOUNTED FOR REAL, not rendered to a string, because every part of this is an
 * effect: the observer that watches the viewport, the 150 ms pause that
 * separates pointing from sweeping past, and the `/bootstrap` a warm row pays.
 * A static render runs none of them, which is exactly why it is the right tool
 * for the first assertion here and the wrong one for the rest.
 *
 * `next/link` IS STUBBED TO AN ANCHOR THAT RECORDS ITS `prefetch`. The real one
 * needs the App Router's contexts and would answer this file's question —
 * "is this row cold or warm" — only indirectly, through whether it happened to
 * issue a request. The prop IS the decision; read it directly.
