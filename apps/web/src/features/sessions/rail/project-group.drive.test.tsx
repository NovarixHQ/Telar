/**
 * THE RAIL SAYS THE DRIVE IS AWAY — issue #534.
 *
 * A project on an external drive is unreadable whenever the drive is elsewhere,
 * which is the ordinary state of an external drive — so what this pins is as
 * much about TONE as about text: a muted chip like the host badges beside it,
 * never a warning, and never the one piece of advice that would cost somebody
 * their project id ("re-register it"). The rows underneath still draw, because
 * their history still reads.
 *
 * RENDERED RATHER THAN SCANNED, for `project-group.rows.test.tsx`'s reason: the
 * question is what a reader sees, and markup is the only place to ask it.
