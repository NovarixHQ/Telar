/**
 * #354 — THE HARNESS'S OWN TEMP PATHS DO NOT BELONG IN THE LANE.
 *
 * Packaged Dev 6aafdfe9, a data-science turn: three
 * `Read file /private/tmp/claude-502/bundled-skills/…/dataviz/…` rows and a
 * `Ran command cd /private/tmp/claude-502/… && node …`, drawn at the same size
 * as the work on the reader's project. These render the real components, so
 * "the path is not in the markup" IS "the reader is not shown it".
