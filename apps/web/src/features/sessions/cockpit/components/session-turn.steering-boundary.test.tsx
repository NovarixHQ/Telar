/**
 * STEERING A RUNNING TURN MUST NOT TURN THE ANSWER INTO A TOOL STEP.
 *
 * Reported against packaged Dev c4882d80: typing while the assistant was
 * mid-sentence swept the half-written reply into a collapsed "N steps" fold
 * ABOVE the message, where it went on streaming out of sight. The cause was
 * the response CLOSED by the steer being drawn as one `ActivityGroup` while
 * every other response was cut at its seams — so prose stayed prose only
 * until somebody interrupted.
 *
 * These render the real `SessionTurn`. A collapsed run omits its rows from the
 * DOM entirely, so "the text is in the markup" IS "the reader can see it".
