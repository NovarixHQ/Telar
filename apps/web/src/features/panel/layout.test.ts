/**
 * HOW WIDE THE PANEL OPENS, and whose answer that is.
 *
 * An Editor tab at the list width (480px) is a notebook, a PDF page or
 * a file-beside-its-tree in a column too narrow for any of them, so every one
 * of them asked to be dragged wider on sight (#357). The rule has to raise the
 * DEFAULT without ever touching a width the person chose — including a narrow
 * one, which is the case a naive "make it at least 720" would quietly undo.
