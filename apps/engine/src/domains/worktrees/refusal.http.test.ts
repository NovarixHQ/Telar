/**
 * WHEN A WORKTREE CANNOT BE CUT, THE CALLER IS TOLD WHY — issue #695.
 *
 * `prepareSessionWorktree` writes its refusals as sentences for a person: the
 * drive that is not connected, the folder that is gone, the directory that is not
 * a repository, the branch name the engine will not create, the base ref that
 * does not resolve. Every one of them is raised ON THE REQUEST rather than left
 * for the row, on the stated grounds that the caller is still there to be told
 * (see worktree.ts's header on the #496 seam).
 *
 * AND THEN THE HTTP BOUNDARY THREW THEM AWAY. `WorktreeError` was not an
 * `EngineStateError`, so `errorFor` fell through to
 * `500 internal_error, "engine encountered an internal error"` — five careful
 * sentences replaced by one that says nothing, in front of the one gesture whose
 * whole promise is that it refuses with the reason (#695's row action). This file
 * pins the crossing, not the wording: each arm asserts the code a client can
 * branch on and the phrase the engine chose, so a reworded refusal stays a
 * refusal and a re-classified one fails here.
 *
 * THE UNMOUNTED ARM IS NOT HERE. It never reached `WorktreeError` over HTTP —
 * `assertProjectAvailable` refuses first with `conflict` — and
 * `domains/projects/availability.http.test.ts` already pins that sentence. Asserting it
 * again here would pin the same behaviour to the wrong cause.
