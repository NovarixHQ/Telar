/**
 * THE MODEL PICKER'S ROW AND ITS SEARCH SCOPE (#657).
 *
 * Facundo asked for exactly two things after preferring T3 Code's picker to
 * ours — the row's organisation, and the rail collapsing in search mode.
 *
 * ── THE SEARCH FIELD IS DRIVEN HERE (#732) ──────────────────────────────────
 * It could not be when this file was written. The note that stood here said
 * typing into a controlled input was impossible in this app's environment and
 * that the rail's collapse and the empty state's wording were therefore left to
 * a manual eye. That was true of the environment and false of the cause: React
 * freezes `isInputEventSupported` from `canUseDOM` at import, and a test file's
 * static `import` of `react-dom/client` is hoisted above its own
 * `GlobalRegistrator.register()`, so React was routing controlled inputs down
 * an IE polyfill. `scripts/test-dom.mjs` imports react-dom while the preload's
 * DOM is up and the path works; `test/type-into.ts` is the helper.
 *
 * So the residue #732 recorded is paid off below: a query really is typed, and
 * the rail going away, the scope the query then reads, and the words the empty
 * state chooses are all read off the mounted picker. `searchScope` stays
 * exported and unit-checked — three drivers against two answers is cheaper
 * stated directly than mounted six times — but it is no longer standing in for
 * the wiring.
 *
 * ── IF THIS FILE IS HANGING, READ THIS FIRST ────────────────────────────────
 * The typing tests below depend on that preload import, and they do not fail
 * without it — THEY HANG. A process at 96% of a core, no output, no test name,
 * nothing naming this file or that import. Measured once at about eight
 * minutes before it was killed, on a machine also running the cockpit.
 *
 * So if the suite is spinning and you are bisecting to find out where: check
 * whether `await import("react-dom/client")` is still in
 * `scripts/test-dom.mjs` before you suspect anything here. That is the only
 * condition in which this has been seen, and it is not a state the repo ships
 * in — it happens when somebody removes that line to find out what it was for.
 *
 * The honest limit of this note: the hang was observed once and deliberately
 * not reproduced, because re-running it costs another eight minutes of a
 * pegged core to confirm something already written down. The cause is unknown.
 * What IS known is that it is specific to this file — `lib/testing/
 * type-into.test.tsx` depends on the same import and fails cleanly in under a
 * second — so a hang here is not evidence that the #732 fix is wrong, and not
 * something every test built on it inherits.
 *
 * ── THE REAL COMPONENT AGAINST A STUBBED `fetch` ────────────────────────────
 * `mock.module` would replace `lib/model-catalogue-cache` for the whole run,
 * and the composer, the settings Models tab and the `/` menu all reach through
 * it. Stubbing the two routes costs a few lines more and exercises the real hooks,
 * the real caching and the real family/generation/connection libs.
