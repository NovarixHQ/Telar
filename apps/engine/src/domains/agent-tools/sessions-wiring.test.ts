/**
 * The `sessions` toolkit's WIRING — the two seams between the wall and a real
 * turn, neither of which `domains/sessions/tools/tools-*.test.ts` can reach.
 *
 *   1. THE DRIVER SEAM. That the seven tools reach a model at all, under the
 *      one `telar` server like every other Telar capability, and that a turn
 *      carrying no capability gets NO sessions tools rather than empty ones —
 *      a model handed a `sessions_list` that answers "nothing is live" for an
 *      engine it cannot see would report that as the truth.
 *   2. THE WORKER SEAM, which is the deployment an actual session runs in. The
 *      worker holds no store handle: it builds the capability out of
 *      `EngineClient` calls, so every rule has to survive a round trip over
 *      loopback rather than being enforced in the same process. The one that
 *      matters most is `origin: "session"` — it is declared by the worker's own
 *      code, and without it a list could not say an agent asked.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SPENDS ANYTHING. The SDK is a fake with a `tool` factory that
 * remembers names, and the turn driver is a fake that calls the capability it
 * was handed and returns. No provider is loaded, no CLI is resolved.
