/**
 * WHO MAY RUN WHAT, PINNED PER PROVIDER — including the places where this
 * change ALTERED behaviour rather than merely preserving it.
 *
 * Two things needed pinning and neither was covered before:
 *
 *   1. Codex's approval arm used to answer `tool_call` for EVERY MCP tool. It
 *      now runs the engine's own classifier, so a ratified read auto-accepts
 *      there as it always did on Claude. That is a REAL CHANGE to Codex's
 *      behaviour — a widening for reads — made deliberately to end a split where
 *      one tool had two authorities depending on which provider called it. It is
 *      asserted here rather than described.
 *   2. The ratified set is a MODULE GLOBAL, and the out-of-process worker is a
 *      different process from the daemon that installs it. An uninstalled
 *      process must fail CLOSED: everything asks.
