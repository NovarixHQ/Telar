/**
 * EVERY TOOL ANSWER, MEASURED — issue #515.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE IS DIFFERENT FROM `domains/sessions/tools/tools-*.test.ts` ────────────────
 * That file runs against a real store on a real repository, because what it
 * asserts is that the RULES exist. This one asserts a NUMBER, and a number
 * needs a fixture big enough to break the thing being measured: 500 sessions,
 * a 5,000-event journal, 685 turns, 200 notes. Cutting 500 worktrees to get
 * there would take minutes and prove nothing extra, so the capability here is a
 * fake — which is exactly right for a test about how much a wall SAYS rather
 * than about what the engine underneath it allows.
 *
 * ── WHAT A FAILURE HERE MEANS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A tool answer is not output; it is the caller's context window, spent. Before
 * this issue `sessions_list` spent 142,703 characters of it in one call — more
 * than a small model has — and `sessions_status` 80,755 to answer "is it
 * finished yet". Both were correct. Neither was usable. So the assertion is a
 * ceiling per tool, and a tool that grows past its ceiling fails here rather
 * than in somebody's session.
 *
 * ── AND THE ANSWER MUST STILL PARSE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `bounded` in `tool-kit.ts` is the backstop under every JSON answer, and it
 * clips CHARACTERS: an answer that reaches it comes back as JSON with its tail
 * cut off and a marker where the cut happened. That is the right last resort
 * and the wrong ordinary case, so this file asserts both halves — under the
 * ceiling, AND still parseable. A tool that can only meet the first is a tool
 * whose own paging is missing, and the second assertion is what says so.
