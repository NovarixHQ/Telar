/**
 * THE FIRST OPEN OF A SURFACE STAYS INSIDE THE PANEL — issue #896.
 *
 * The symptom was "opening the Editor flashes the whole cockpit, but only the
 * first time". The cause is one line of Next's: `dynamic()` in the App Router
 * hands `Loadable` neither `ssr: false` nor a `loading`, and `Loadable` adds a
 * `Suspense` of its own ONLY when it has one of those — otherwise it wraps its
 * `React.lazy` in a bare `Fragment`. So the first render of a chunk nobody has
 * fetched suspends up to the nearest boundary, which for a conversation is the
 * route's `loading.tsx`. The whole conversation is replaced by the page
 * skeleton and drawn again when the chunk lands. Second open, module cached, no
 * suspension, no flash — which is why it read as a haunting rather than a bug.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE STANDS THE SHIPPED SHAPE UP BY HAND rather than trusting the
 * `next/dynamic` it can import. There are two of them. The App Router build
 * resolves `next/dynamic` to `dist/shared/lib/app-dynamic.js`, which passes no
 * `loading` and therefore gets the Fragment. Outside a Next build — here, under
 * bun — the package's own export map resolves it to `dist/shared/lib/dynamic.js`,
 * the pages-router spelling, and THAT one defaults `loading` to a function. Its
 * `Loadable` therefore always has a boundary, with a fallback that renders
 * null. Mounting the real panel here and watching for the route's fallback
 * would be green with the fix and green without it: the environment supplies
 * the boundary the bug is about. `boundary is the difference` below is
 * therefore built on the App Router's shape, and `the premise` pins that shape
 * against the day a Next upgrade moves it.
 *
 * `the panel opens` at the end is the end-to-end leg, and its reach is smaller
 * than it looks for the reason just given: it says the panel commits its
 * `<aside>` on the first frame and keeps that same node while a surface's chunk
 * resolves. It is NOT what holds our `Suspense` in place — the
 * `dynamic-render-sites-have-a-boundary` invariant in scripts/source-invariants.mjs
 * is, and it is the thing to fix if it ever goes red.
 *
 * The DOM is registered for this file and handed back in `afterAll`, because
 * the suite shares one process and its neighbours are written for a world with
 * no `window` in it.
