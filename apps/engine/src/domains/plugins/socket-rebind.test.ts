/**
 * WHAT HAPPENS TO A LIVE PROVIDER WHEN A PROJECT CHANGES WHICH PLUGINS ARE ON.
 *
 * This file exists because the first draft of the plugin socket got it wrong in
 * a way that nothing else caught. Every binding shares ONE listener and
 * therefore one url; the driver fingerprint held that url; so going from
 * enabled-set A to a different non-empty set B rebound the socket — revoking
 * A's token — while leaving the fingerprint unchanged. The provider kept the
 * query it was started with, whose Authorization header was now dead, and every
 * plugin call 401'd.
 *
 * The three properties that make that impossible are asserted here against a
 * REAL worker driving a REAL socket over loopback:
 *
 *   A → B      rebinds, the new credential works, and the OLD bearer is refused
 *   A → A      does not rebind, so a reused query keeps working
 *   A → B      moves the Claude driver's fingerprint, so its in-process
 *              query cold-starts onto the new wall
 *
 * Temp engine root, temp project. No real home, no provider process, no token
 * is ever logged.
