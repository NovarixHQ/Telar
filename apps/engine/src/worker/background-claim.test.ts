/**
 * #891 — A TASK THE ENGINE KEEPS ALIVE PAST TURN END ALWAYS HAS A CLAIM ITS
 * PERMISSION REQUESTS ARE HONOURED UNDER.
 *
 * The end-to-end half of the invariant, against a real daemon, a real store and
 * a real worker; `driver.test.ts` owns the Claude driver's side of it. What
 * this file pins is the seam between them — that the engine really does keep
 * the row alive, really does refuse the settled turn's claim, and really does
 * open a turn for the work when the driver asks for one.
 *
 * THE CONTRADICTION IT CLOSES. `completeTurn` calls `closeOrphanedTasks` with
 * `includeBackground: false` on purpose: outliving its turn is what
 * backgrounding means. The same call settles the only claim that row's requests
 * could be made under. Two deliberate decisions, opposite in effect, and the
 * gap between them is where sixteen sub-agent transcripts died — the child's
 * every mutating call answered "turn has already settled (completed); this
 * report arrived after the turn ended", which a model reads as the person
 * saying no.
