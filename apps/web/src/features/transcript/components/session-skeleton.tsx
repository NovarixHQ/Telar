/**
 * WHAT A CONVERSATION LOOKS LIKE BEFORE IT ARRIVES (#407).
 *
 * A `loading.tsx` is not decoration here; it is what lets the router COMMIT the
 * navigation at all. Without a Suspense boundary around a dynamic segment, Next
 * holds the old screen until the new one's server render has come back, so
 * pressing a row in the rail did nothing visible for as long as that took — the
 * exact complaint in the issue. With one, the press paints instantly and the
 * conversation streams into the frame it drew.
 *
 * IT DRAWS THE ROOM, NOT A SPINNER. The masthead bar, a few message blocks and
 * the composer's floor sit where the real ones will, so the arriving transcript
 * lands in a layout that has already settled rather than shoving one aside. The
 * shapes are deliberately vague — a skeleton that guesses at the number of turns
 * is a skeleton that is usually wrong, and the flicker of being corrected costs
 * more than it saves.
 *
 * NO ANIMATION BEYOND A PULSE, and no text. Anything this screen said would be
 * a sentence about our own plumbing, addressed to somebody who pressed a button
 * half a second ago and is still looking at where the answer will be.
