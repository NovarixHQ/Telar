/**
 * THE TERMINAL SURFACE SURVIVES A GLANCE AT ANOTHER TAB — issue #909.
 *
 * THE MULTIPLIER, AND WHY IT IS MEASURED IN CONSTRUCTIONS. The panel rendered
 * only its active tab, so every switch away unmounted the whole Terminal
 * surface and every return built it again: a fresh `Terminal` per shell, each
 * with a new WebGL context and glyph atlas, the host's terminal re-adopted, and
 * a run's whole byte window replayed into an empty buffer. None of that is
 * visible in the finished screen — it looks the same once it has arrived — so
 * what this file counts is how many emulators were built and how many shells
 * were asked for, which is the cost the owner was waiting through.
 *
 * `term.open()` IS THE COUNTER. It is called exactly once per `Terminal` this
 * app constructs (terminal-surface.tsx `createTerminal`), it is on the public
 * prototype, and unlike the constructor it cannot be reached by an instance
 * that was never mounted into a document.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED HERE: that the emulator DRAWS after the reveal. There is
 * no canvas in this environment — `right-panel.suspense.test.tsx` and
 * `session/terminal-surface.test.tsx` both say so — and the acceptance for the
 * pixels is the owner's own tab.
