 * BEFORE ANYTHING RESOLVES A BINARY, and therefore the first statement here.

 * A Finder-launched app gets a four-entry PATH, so every version-managed
 * install — nvm, fnm, mise, asdf, volta, bun, pnpm — is invisible to it. This
 * asks the login shell once and repairs `process.env.PATH` in place, which is
 * what lets `cli-resolution.ts` trust PATH instead of enumerating install
 * directories it can never finish enumerating.
 *
 * ON THE ENTRY POINTS RATHER THAN IN `startEngine`: spawning an interactive
 * shell is a thing a PROCESS does once, not a thing a library call should do —
 * and every engine test constructs a daemon, none of which should be paying for
 * a shell or inheriting whatever this machine's profile exports.

 * `worker_unavailable` until a separate `bun run worker` registered — which
 * made "the engine runs on its own" false in the most literal way.
 *
 * TELAR_EMBEDDED_WORKER=0 turns it off, for the deployment where the
 * worker is deliberately its own process (provider crashes stay out of the

// The `telar` skill is installed into each provider's own skills directory on
// start (and removed when the toggle is off). Passed from here rather than
// defaulted inside `startEngine` for the reason the two decisions above are:
// writing into `~/.claude/skills` is a thing a process does, not a thing every

 * A LIVE LOCK IS AN ORDINARY CONDITION AND EXITS SAYING SO — issue #894.
 *
 * Without this, a second Telar meeting a daemon that is already up died on an
 * unhandled rejection: exit code 1, a stack trace on a stdout a packaged app
 * sends nowhere, and a shell that read the 1 as "the engine died" and quit with
 * nothing on screen. The condition is not a failure — the store has an owner
 * and it is alive — so it gets a code of its own and one readable line.
 *
 * THE LINE NAMES THE LOCK AND ITS OWNER, because those are the two things a
 * person needs to act: the pid is already in the error's message (see
 * `acquireDaemonLock`) and the path is what `rm` would take if that pid turns
 * out to be gone. Every OTHER startup failure keeps exiting 1 — the shell's
 * blanket quit is right for an engine that really died.
