/**
 * ONE ARRIVAL DRAWS ONE NOTIFICATION ROW — issue #590.
 *
 * ── THE BUG ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The owner watched one `sessions_send` paint two rows, one above the other,
 * differing only in their trailing text; and a coordinator's transcript paint
 * FOUR identical "Session finished a turn" lines for two wakes.
 *
 * Both are the same defect. An arrival that opens a turn is stored on the TURN
 * and on the turn's first ITEM on purpose (`notification.ts`), and the cockpit
 * drew both: `turn.notification` as the turn's header, and the
 * `notification_${runId}` item as a row inside the turn. For a peer's message
 * the two at least differed — the header is passed `turn.prompt`, the item row
 * falls back to the engine's summary — and for a WAKE, which has no message on
 * either side, they rendered the identical string.
 *
 * ── WHAT THESE PIN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * That the header survives and the item row goes, keyed on the item's id; and
 * that a notification which landed MID-turn, which has no header of its own,
 * still draws. These render the real `SessionTurn`, so the count is the count a
 * reader sees.
