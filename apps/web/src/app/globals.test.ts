/**
 * The palette has to be REACHABLE and COMPLETE.
 *
 * Two failure modes, both silent, both shipped here before:
 *
 * 1. A TOKEN READ BUT NEVER DEFINED. CSS does not warn: an undefined `var()` in
 *    `border: 1px solid var(--x)` falls back to `currentColor`, so a hairline
 *    draws as heavy ink, and `color: var(--x)` drops the declaration and
 *    inherits. Nothing fails; it just looks wrong, which is the hardest kind of
 *    wrong to attribute. Three tokens were read 23 times and defined never.
 *
 * 2. A TOKEN DEFINED BUT NEVER BRIDGED. Tailwind v4 only emits a utility for a
 *    `--color-*` name it can see in the `@theme` block, so a token declared in
 *    `:root` and nowhere else is unreachable — `text-success` compiles to
 *    nothing and leaves the text whatever it inherited.
 *
 * Both are checked against the file rather than against a list, so adding a
 * token cannot quietly skip either half.

/**
 * A CARD MUST PAINT — issue #691, and the half of the wash contract that had no
 * test at all.
 *
 * `globals.css` argues the rule out at length and `globals.test.ts` checked it
 * from the stylesheet's side only: that the wash thins nothing it does not own,
 * that the opt-in is a class, that the floors are declared once. None of that
 * can see a CALL SITE, and the call sites are where it broke. The Git surfaces
 * drew a comment card as `rounded-md border border-border` with an author bar
 * and no fill of its own — correct-looking for as long as the panel behind it was
 * opaque, and a 1px hairline over the desktop holding a paragraph the moment it
 * was not. The rule was never disputed; nothing enforced it.
 *
 * THE RULE IS DRAWN BY WHAT A SURFACE HOLDS, not by what it is:
 *
 *   - A READING SURFACE NEVER THINS. A comment body, a diff hunk, a CI log, a
 *     file view, the composer — anything read word by word, at 100% at every
 *     slider setting.
 *   - CHROME MAY THIN FREELY. The rail, the panel shell, section headers, tab
 *     strips, gutters, chips, a `kbd`. This is where glass reads as glass.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THE THREE GUARDS BELOW HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SCOPES, and the split is
 * the honest part rather than a shortcut. "Holds prose" is not a property of a
 * class string: `rounded-full border px-2.5` is a filter chip in one file and a
 * status pill in another, and a guard that called both a card would have to be
 * satisfied by painting forty chips that are correct as they are. So the first
 * assertion is APP-WIDE, over the one shape that cannot be anything but a card —
 * a bordered box that CLIPS its children is a wrapper around content, always —
 * and the two that need to know what a surface holds run over the surfaces that
