/**
 * A SESSION WITH NO PROJECT AND NO WORKING DIRECTORY (#526).
 *
 * ON `codex` SINCE #531. These were written against the `telar` driver because
 * that was the one project-less thing in the engine; it is gone, and the
 * property under test never had anything to do with it — a session with no
 * project is a shape any driver can be given. Codex rather than Claude for the
 * reason the ordinary-session case below already gives: a Claude claim waits on
 * the model catalogue.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING PINNED, and why each one is worth a test rather than a comment:
 *
 *   - that a project-less create produces `workspace.mode === "none"` and NO
 *     path — the field's absence is the statement, and a reader that found an
 *     empty string there would happily `path.resolve` against the process cwd;
 *   - that a WORKTREE cannot be asked for without a project, and is refused
 *     rather than downgraded: silently handing back a `local` session is how a
 *     caller ends up with a conversation working somewhere it did not choose;
 *   - that the CLAIM omits `projectRoot` entirely, because the worker's folder
 *     check keys on its absence;
 *   - that the worker's folder check is skipped for exactly that claim and
 *     still fires for a checkout that has gone missing;
 *   - that a driver which SPAWNS refuses such a turn by name, so a routing
 *     mistake reads as one rather than as a broken CLI;
 *   - that the store refuses file and diff reads on such a session instead of
 *     answering about some other directory.
 *
 * NO DAEMON AND NO CLI: every one of these is a store call, a claim, or a
 * driver's own early refusal.
