 * Every defect below is a bug in the COMMAND — which pathspec was passed, which

 * The sibling suite keeps the fakes: they cover the PARSING of git's output,
 * where a real repository buys nothing and costs a subprocess.

 * diffs through the index and comes back LF while an untracked one goes through
 * `git diff --no-index`, reads the working file raw, and comes back CRLF — so
 * one file list would draw two different line endings depending on whether git

 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, on git 2.55: neither half holds. `--no-index` applies
 * `core.autocrlf` as well — under `autocrlf=true` BOTH arms come back LF, and
 * with it off BOTH keep the `\r` — and `--ignore-cr-at-eol` changes nothing
 * either way, because it is a COMPARISON option and every line of a new file is
 * an addition with nothing to compare against.
 *
 * So the flag was not added: it would have been a change that does nothing,
