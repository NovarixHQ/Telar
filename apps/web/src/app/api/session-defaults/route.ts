 * What a new session is built with when nobody said — today, the workspace:
 * the project's own checkout, or a worktree of its own.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT-SCOPED, like the inbox rule beside it and for the same reason:
 * the desktop shell and a browser tab on one engine must agree about what "new
 * session" means, or the composer's pre-selected answer looks like a bug.
 *
 * FORWARDED UNVALIDATED, also like the inbox rule: the set of legal modes lives
 * next to the schema in the engine, and a second copy here could disagree.
