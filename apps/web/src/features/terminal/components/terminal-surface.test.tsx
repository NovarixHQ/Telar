/**
 * THE SURFACE, MOUNTED, AGAINST A FAKE HOST AND A REAL XTERM.JS.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT CHECKED HERE, stated rather than implied:
 *
 *   - CHECKED: that a shell is asked for exactly once, that a running one is
 *     re-adopted instead of a second being opened, that a terminal ending is
 *     reported without ever reading as "finished", and that the emulator is
 *     refused — with a sentence — where a PTY would be a lie.
 *   - NOT CHECKED, and cannot be from here: that an IMAGE renders. The image
 *     addon decodes on a canvas and a worker, and this environment has neither
 *     — `@xterm/addon-webgl` does not even load (no WebGL2), which this file
 *     relies on to exercise the fallback path. So the assertion below is that
 *     the addon ACTIVATED, which is observable, and the acceptance criterion
 *     for a drawn image is the owner's own `fastfetch` in a real tab.
 *
 * `right-panel.chooser.test.tsx` explains why a DOM is registered per file.
