/**
 * A RUN'S WINDOW, WRITTEN SO XTERM CAN YIELD INSIDE IT — issue #909.
 *
 * THE DEFECT WAS NOT WHAT REACHED THE SCREEN, which is why nothing about the
 * buffer can state it. `chunks.join("")` draws the same characters as the
 * chunks written in order — the engine cuts them at redactor boundaries, so no
 * sequence straddles one. What differs is the COST: xterm's `WriteBuffer`
 * checks its 12 ms yield budget between write ITEMS and never inside one, so a
 * joined window is one uninterrupted parse of up to 256 KB followed by a
 * reflow of 3000 lines, with the click that opened the chip queued behind all
 * of it. The owner's report — "opening the Terminal freezes everything for
 * seconds while a Run is executing" — is that one string.
 *
 * So the assertion is about the CALLS, not the cells: what this file counts is
 * how many items the emulator was handed and what was in each. It watches
 * `Terminal.prototype.write` because that is the one door
 * `lib/terminal-session.ts`'s writer goes through, and it is the same door for
 * both feeds — the bridge's attach and the hop's poll each read the run from
 * the top and each used to join.
 *
 * `right-panel.chooser.test.tsx` explains why a DOM is registered per file.
