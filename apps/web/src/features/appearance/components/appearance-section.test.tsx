/**
 * THE APPEARANCE PANE IS STACKED GROUPS, NOT TABS — issue #399.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING GUARDED. The complaint was not that any one control
 * was wrong; it was that three quarters of the pane was behind a `Tabs` strip,
 * so "what can I change here?" could only be answered by clicking four times,
 * and settings search pointed at rows that did not exist until you did. Both
 * facts are structural, and both are invisible to a test of any single control
 * — so what is pinned here is the SHAPE: every group on the page at once, no
 * tablist anywhere, and the Window rows carrying the anchors the search index
 * computes for them without ever rendering the pane.
 *
 * MOUNTED, NOT SERVER-RENDERED. The backdrop group reads payloads that live in
 * localStorage, so it holds back to "nothing under the app" for the one render
 * that happens before the stores can be read. `renderToStaticMarkup` would
 * therefore assert against a pane in its pre-hydration state, which is not the
 * pane this file is about.
