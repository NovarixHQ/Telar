/**
 * A CANNED MODEL LIST FOR ENGINE TESTS, so a daemon under test never spawns
 * the real Claude CLI.
 *
 * Without `models`, the first Claude turn that names no model makes the store
 * ask the installed `claude` for its catalogue through the SDK handshake
 * (`readClaudeModels`), and `prepareClaudeCatalogue` gives that two seconds.
 * On a developer's Mac the CLI answers in about five; on the CI Mac mini under
 * several Verify runs it can take longer still. Every test that submitted a
 * Claude turn was paying that, and the ones with a four-second wait were
 * losing the race — the "unblocked by the heartbeat" flake in #266.
 *
 * Long-window rows, because that is what the store requires before it will
 * claim a model-less Claude turn (see `claudeSelectionState`).
