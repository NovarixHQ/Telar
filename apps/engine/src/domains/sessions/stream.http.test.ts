/**
 * EVERY SESSION'S EVENTS, ON ONE CONNECTION — issue #586, step 2.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * EVERY TEST HERE CLOSES ITS STREAM IN THE SAME TEST THAT OPENS IT. An SSE
 * response never ends by itself, so a reader left open holds the daemon's
 * `close()` for ever and the failure lands on whichever test runs next.
 *
 * THE FRAME IS THIN ON PURPOSE and the assertions say so: which session, which
 * event id, what kind. A frame is never the record — it names a fact the reader
 * re-derives from `/events`. Plugin events are the exception, covered in
 * `domains/plugins/events.http.test.ts`.
