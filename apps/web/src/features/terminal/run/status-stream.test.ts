/**
 * The fold from a `run.status` frame onto a `/run/status` answer (#890).
 *
 * THE RULE UNDER TEST IS THAT A READER CANNOT TELL THE TWO APART. The masthead

 * to be shaped exactly like one the engine sent — the same list, the same
 * ordering — or the pill would drift from what a second window shows.
