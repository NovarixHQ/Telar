/**
 * #576 — THE SOLO ROUTE NEVER MOUNTS THE APP RAIL.
 *
 * NOT "IS IT HIDDEN". The owner refused the cheap version of this issue for a
 * reason the DOM can be asked about directly: a rail collapsed to 48px is still
 * mounted, still in the layout and still downloaded, which on a headset already
 * simulating a room is the cost that matters. So every assertion below is about
 * PRESENCE IN THE TREE, and one of them is about whether the module was ever
 * pulled in at all — the test-time reading of "does not fetch its chunk", which
 * is what `dynamic()` buys and what a CSS rule cannot.
 *
 * THE RAIL IS REPLACED BY A MARKER. `app-sidebar.tsx` is the largest component
 * in the app and drags the command palette in behind it; what this file is
 * about is whether the shell ASKS for it, and a stub answers that exactly while
 * keeping the test a test rather than a render of the whole cockpit.
