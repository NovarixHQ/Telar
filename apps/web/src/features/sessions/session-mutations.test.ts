/**
 * WHAT A MUTATION IS ALLOWED TO COST — issue #495, and this file is the
 * acceptance for it.
 *
 * THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS IS THE LIVE-LIST READ. Before this, every verb on a
 * rail row ended in `onRefresh()`, which the rail answered with `loadAll()`:
 * one `hosts()` read plus one `/api/sessions/live` read PER PAIRED MAC, per
 * click. So the recorded reads below are not a performance smoke test — they
 * are the whole feature, and a regression would be invisible in every other
 * assertion this suite makes.
 *
 * ONE TEST PER MUTATION, DELIBERATELY REPETITIVE. Settle, pin, snooze, rename
 * and delete are five call sites across two components, and a shared "no reads
 * happened" helper run once would pass while four of them had quietly grown a
 * reload back.
 *
 * AND THE ORDER OF THE THREE STATES IS ASSERTED, not just the endpoint: the
 * guess must land BEFORE the request goes out, or "optimistic" is only a word
 * for "the same wait with a nicer name".
