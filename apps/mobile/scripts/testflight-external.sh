# Offer an uploaded nightly to TestFlight's EXTERNAL group "Nightly".
# nightly.sh calls this after `altool --upload-app` has said UPLOAD SUCCEEDED;
# by then the internal group already has the build (no review, live once
# processing ends). External testers need three more things, and Apple does
# none of them on its own:
#
#   1. wait until App Store Connect has PROCESSED the build (VALID),
#   2. give the build its "What to Test" text (Beta App Review refuses a
#      submission without one — measured on the first submission by hand),
#   3. add the build to the external group,
#   4. submit it for Beta App Review.
#
# The first build of each new marketing version sits in Beta App Review for
# hours, sometimes a day; later builds of the SAME version are re-approved in
# minutes. That is Apple's rule, not this script's, so a nightly right after a
# version bump reaches external testers late and the next one is fast again.
#
# Usage: testflight-external.sh <build-number>
#   (the minute-stamp nightly.sh minted)
#
# Reads the same credentials as nightly.sh — TELAR_ASC_KEY_ID,
# TELAR_ASC_ISSUER_ID, TELAR_ASC_KEY_PATH (the .p8; Admin role) — and talks to
# App Store Connect API v1 directly, with an ES256 JWT minted here. NOTHING IS
# INSTALLED: python3 (stdlib) builds the token and `openssl dgst` signs it,
# both of which every macOS runner image carries. One signing path rather than
# "cryptography if present, openssl otherwise", because a branch that only runs
# on machines with an optional package is a branch nobody has run.
#
# NEVER PRINT THE TOKEN. The Authorization header is built inside `set +x` and
# passed to curl from a variable; what this script prints is the HTTP status
# of each call and Apple's own `errors[].detail`, never a request.
#
# Exit codes: 0 when the build is offered (or already was); 0 with a
# `::warning::` when processing outran the wait — the upload itself succeeded
# and internal testers have the build, so a slow Apple is not a red nightly;
# non-zero when Apple REFUSED something (INVALID/FAILED processing, no
# external group, any other 4xx).
#
# Overridable for tests and for hand runs, all optional:
#   TELAR_BUNDLE_ID                   the app's bundle id (io.github.novarix.telar)
#   TELAR_ASC_APP_ID                  App Store Connect app id (default: looked up
#                                     from TELAR_BUNDLE_ID)
#   TELAR_TESTFLIGHT_EXTERNAL_GROUP   the external group's name (Nightly)
#   TELAR_ASC_POLL_SECONDS            seconds between processing polls (30)
#   TELAR_ASC_POLL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS    how long to wait for VALID (1800)
#   TELAR_TESTFLIGHT_WHATS_NEW        the en-US "What to Test" text
