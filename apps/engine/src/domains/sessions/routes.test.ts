/**
 * THE SESSION-SCOPED ROUTE TABLE, EXERCISED ACROSS NEIGHBOURS.
 *
 * This file exists because of a specific failure mode, hit three times while
 * the plugin host was ported: an edit to ONE arm of the session router silently
 * removes or shadows the arm beside it, and every suite that tests those arms
 * in isolation still passes.
 *
 * So each case here touches an UNRELATED arm as well as the one it is about.
 * `submitTurn` is the canary — it is nobody's feature, it has nothing to do
 * with plugins or runs, and it is the arm that broke when the run door read the
 * request body for every session request. If a future edit eats a neighbour,
 * this goes red where the feature suites would not.
 *
 * Temp engine home per case. No provider process, no TeX, no kernel: every call
 * either succeeds structurally or is refused at a gate, which is where a machine
 * without those toolchains stops anyway.
