/**
 * ONE REPOSITORY, TWO MACS, ONE HEADER — issue #283, the rendered half.
 *
 * `features/sessions/session-groups.test.ts` pins the KEY as pure set math and
 * `features/hosts/project-places.test.ts` pins the places read off the rows. Neither
 * can prove the thing a reader actually complains about: that the header names
 * both machines, and that its `+` does not silently pick one of them.
 *
 * THE LIVE CHECK IS STILL PENDING. No second Mac was reachable while this was
 * written, so the two hosts here are fixtures. What a paired Mac would add is
 * the round trip, not the rendering.
