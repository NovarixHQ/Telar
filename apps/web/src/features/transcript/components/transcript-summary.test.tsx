/**
 * #354 — A COLLAPSED RUN'S SUMMARY IS THE ONLY THING SAID ABOUT IT.
 *
 * At panel width "27 steps · Said ×3 · ds_inspect · ds_kernel · ds_scratch ×5 ·
 * Ran command ×4 · …" ended in an ellipsis, and what the ellipsis ate was the
 * tail — the tool names and the commands, the part a reader scans a fold for.
 * The generic head survived because it was first.
 *
 * The clipping was CSS, not text: the whole tally has always been in the
 * markup. So these assert both halves of the fix — that the sentence is
 * complete, and that the element is allowed two lines to say it in.
