/**
 * THE STRIP, RENDERED — what a person actually reads off the tabs.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SECOND FILE, and why it renders rather than asserting on
 * `describePanelTabInstance`. That function is already pinned next door in
 * lib/right-panel-tabs.test.ts; what it cannot say is whether the PANEL passes
 * it the right arguments. The suffix is conditional on a sibling of the same
 * kind being open (#322), and that condition is computed in `RightPanel` from
 * the strip it was handed — so the failure this guards is "two Editors, both
 * labelled Editor", which is invisible to a unit test of the formatter.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` reaches the strip because the tabs are ordinary DOM;
 * the menus inside them portal and render as nothing, which is fine — the
 * claim under test is the label text, and the menus have their own tests
 * (session/context-menus.render.test.tsx takes the same approach).
