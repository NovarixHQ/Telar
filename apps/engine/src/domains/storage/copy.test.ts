/**
 * A SAFE COPY OF THE STORE — issue #665.
 *
 * ══ WHY THE ABSENCE OF THIS WAS ITSELF A FINDING ══
 *
 * There was no sanctioned way to look at a store without opening the live one.
 * The only read paths were a size walk and a hand-run `sqlite3 -readonly`
 * snippet pasted into an issue, so every question of the form "what is actually
 * in there" became either a manual query against the one irreplaceable artifact
 * or an estimate — which is what happened in #646 and #658, and why #646's own
 * figures had to be corrected twice.
 *
 * ══ WHAT EACH TEST BELOW IS ACTUALLY HOLDING ══
 *
 *   - the copy OPENS, and holds the same conversations. A copy that opens and
 *     is WRONG is worse than one that refuses, which is why this reads the
 *     copy back through a real `EngineStore` rather than comparing file sizes.
 *   - the ORIGINAL is untouched — no compaction, no watermark, no vacuum. A
 *     "get me a safe copy" that quietly rewrote the source would be the
 *     opposite of the point.
 *   - the reproducible tier is NOT carried, and that is named rather than
 *     inferred from a size: on a real machine `worktrees/` is 59 checkouts and
 *     tens of gigabytes, and a copy that took minutes is a button nobody
 *     presses.
 *   - the destination MUST NOT EXIST. The one thing here that could destroy
 *     anything is writing over a folder somebody named by mistake.
 *   - the copy is 0600. `VACUUM INTO` creates its file with the process umask,
 *     which on a default macOS account is 0644 — a world-readable copy of
 *     every conversation on the machine, made by the button whose whole purpose
 *     is to be the safe way to do this.
