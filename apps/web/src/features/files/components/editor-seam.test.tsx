/**
 * THE SEAM ACROSS THE TOP OF THE EDITOR.
 *
 * The Editor draws a header on both sides of one vertical border — the tree's
 * refresh-and-search line, and the open-file strip — and under the strip a third
 * row naming the file. Each of them used to size itself, so the two `border-b`
 * rules landed 4px apart, the `px-` inset differed three ways, and the address
 * row's height moved when you opened a different KIND of file (#275).
 *
 * Nothing in the type system makes those rows agree; a shared string does, and
 * this is what says so. A future edit that gives one of them its own height has
 * to fail here and come read the note in session/editor-chrome.tsx.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup`, like header-controls.test.tsx: this is about the
 * classes the first paint carries, and no effects need to run for that. Every
 * surface therefore renders its header over a file it has not read yet, which
 * is the state the seam has to be right in too.
