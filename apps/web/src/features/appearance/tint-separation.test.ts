/**
 * THE TINTS ARE VISIBLE — measured, on every scheme and every base colour.
 *
 * globals.test.ts pins the DECLARATION. This file pins the RESULT, and the two
 * are deliberately different kinds of guard: the first reads source and can say
 * nothing about colour, the second evaluates colour and would survive a total
 * rewrite of how the declaration is spelled. #691 shipped the first and said so.
 *
 * EVERYTHING IS READ, NOTHING IS COPIED. The floor and the state vocabulary come
 * out of globals.css — the file they paint from — and the cards are derived the
 * way the app derives them. A second copy of any of those numbers here would be a test
 * that keeps passing while the app changes underneath it, which is the failure
 * mode #691's guards were careful to avoid.
 *
 * WHY THE FLOOR IS A WINDOW AND NOT A MINIMUM. The fill is made of the same
 * token as the ink standing on it, so raising --tint-floor pushes the fill away
 * from the card (good) and toward its own text (bad). The last test measures
 * both walls, and it exists so that "the tints look faint, raise the floor"
 * fails loudly with the other wall's number attached.
