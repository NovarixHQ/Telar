 * version of the same reason: this decides which band EVERY session lands in,
 * so a per-browser copy would show the desktop shell and a browser tab two
 * different inboxes off one engine.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS FORWARDED UNVALIDATED. The engine holds the bound (1..90, or
 * `null` for no clock) next to the schema that states it; re-checking here
 * would be a second copy of a rule that could disagree with the first.
