/**
 * NOTHING APPEARS AT THE STORE ROOT THAT THE PRODUCT DID NOT SANCTION — #665.
 *
 * ══ WHY IT WATCHES THE FILESYSTEM AND NOT THE PROCESS ══
 *
 * The obvious harness monkey-patches `node:fs` and records what was written.
 * It would be blind to most of Telar's writers. `apps/engine/src` alone holds
 * ~114 synchronous `fs` write callsites **and 162 subprocess spawn sites** —
 * git, bun, uv, conda, tectonic, and the agent CLIs, every one of which writes
 * wherever it likes — plus native sqlite, which goes through its own handle and
 * never touches `node:fs` at all, plus Chromium inside Electron.
 *
 * Such a test PASSES, cleanly, while the store grows directories nobody
 * sanctioned. That is the same shape as the guard this repository shipped which
 * greped for a test name, and the perf suite it shipped with its clock at zero.
 *
 * So this snapshots the tree, drives a workload, snapshots again, and diffs. A
 * filesystem diff cannot be evaded by a subprocess, by native sqlite, or by
 * Chromium, because it does not care who wrote.
 *
 * ══ "SANCTIONED" IS THE PRODUCT'S LIST, NOT THIS FILE'S ══
 *
 * The allowlist is derived from `statePaths()` and `DIRECTORY_CATEGORIES` — the
 * same values the code uses to decide where things go and how to measure them.
 * A root-level name added without being declared in one of those fails by
 * construction. That is also why "`statePaths` is the only way to name a
 * store-root file" was a precondition for this test rather than tidying: while
 * nine names were composed by hand elsewhere, there was no list to derive from.
 *
 * ══ THE WORKLOAD IS THE COVERAGE ARGUMENT, AND IT IS WRITTEN DOWN ══
 *
 * This proves nothing about a writer it never provoked. What the run below
 * exercises, in full:
 *
 *   - engine boot on an empty home, and a second boot over the same home
 *   - project registration
 *   - session creation (`local` env mode)
 *   - a turn: submit, claim, mark running, stream two deltas, complete an item,
 *     complete the turn, and a read receipt
 *   - an MCP server registration
 *   - session defaults and the published appearance blob
 *   - the execution store's own housekeeping on open
 *
 * **Everything else is out of this test's reach**, and the ones worth naming:
 * worktree-mode sessions (they need a real git repository and a `git worktree
 * add` subprocess), the data-science and LaTeX plugins (they install
 * toolchains), the headless browser (it needs Chromium), dictation, and
 * anything a provider CLI writes. A directory only those create would not be
 * caught here, and adding one of them to the workload is how that changes.
 *
 * ══ AND A CANARY PER WRITER CLASS, BECAUSE A BLIND HARNESS PASSES ══
 *
 * `the harness sees every writer` below creates an unsanctioned file three
 * ways — in-process `fs`, a SPAWNED CHILD, and sqlite's own handle — and
 * asserts the diff reports each. If a canary were invisible the harness would
 * be blind, and the blindness would fail CI rather than be discovered a year
 * later. The three are separate because they fail differently.
