/**
 * A PROJECT ON AN EXTERNAL DRIVE, through the store — issue #534.

 * `volumes.test.ts` pins what the probe decides; this file is about what the

 * every surface reads, what stops happening while a drive is away, and the
 * recovery that keeps a project's id when macOS remounts it at `<name> 1`.
 *
 * Every drive here is `fakeMounts()` — real directories in a temp folder with a
 * synthesized device and uuid. Nothing mounts or unmounts a real volume, and no
 * project of the person running this is ever registered.
