 * THE KEYBOARD MUST SHRINK THE PAGE, NOT COVER IT.
 *
 * With no viewport export Next emits the bare default, and the default on iOS
 * is `overlays-content`: the software keyboard is painted OVER the layout
 * without changing its size. Every `dvh` and every `h-full` column therefore
 * still measures the whole screen, and whatever sits at the bottom of one —
 * the composer's action row, with the send button in it — ends up underneath
 * the keys. On a new session that made the message unsendable without first
 * dismissing the keyboard, which is a lot to ask of someone who has just
 * finished typing.
 *
 * `resizes-content` makes the layout viewport shrink when the keyboard opens,
 * so the composer rides above it the way it does in every native app.
 *
 * `viewport-fit=cover` comes along because the two belong together on a
 * notched phone: content may now reach the physical edges, and the app's
 * safe-area insets are what keep it off them.
