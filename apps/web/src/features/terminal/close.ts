/**
 * CLOSING A TERMINAL ENDS WHAT RUNS IN IT — and whether to ASK first.
 *
 * "Run = a new terminal" made the terminal the owner of its process: closing a
 * chip, the whole Terminal tab, or an entry in the masthead's Run menu ends the
 * process group inside it. There is no "close the chip, the run keeps going"
 * any more, so a close is a real kill, and a kill of somebody's dev server or a
 * half-finished `git rebase` deserves a question.
 *
 * ONLY WHEN SOMETHING IS ACTUALLY RUNNING. An idle shell at its prompt loses
 * nothing when it closes, and asking about it anyway is how people learn to
 * press Enter on every dialog without reading it. The host answers "is
 * anything running in these terminals" with one process-table read, taken
 * only when asked (`terminal.active`), and this file turns that answer into
 * either "close" or one sentence to confirm.
 *
 * THE DECISION IS PURE AND SEPARATE FROM THE ASKING, so the rule — which
 * terminals count, what the sentence says, what an unanswerable question
 * means — is tested as a function, without a host or a dialog.
