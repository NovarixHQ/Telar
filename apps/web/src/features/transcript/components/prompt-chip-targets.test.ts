/**
 * WHICH CHIPS IN A SENT MESSAGE OPEN SOMETHING.
 *
 * The mapping lives beside the chip that renders it (`panelTabFor` in
 * features/transcript/components/prompt-text.tsx); this pins the half of it that is a
 * DECISION rather than a lookup — that three kinds open and three do not, and
 * which of the two a given reference is. Getting that wrong in either direction
 * is a visible defect: a chip that looks pressable and is not, or one that opens
 * something adjacent to what you pressed.
