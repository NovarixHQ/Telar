/**
 * DELETING A BROWSER PROFILE, FROM THE ROW THAT OFFERS IT (#430).
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG WAS SILENCE. Delete did nothing on a machine that had been
 * used for a while: the shell refused every profile some session merely NAMED
 * (fixed in browser-manager's `whyProfileIsInUse`), and the pane's own
 * disabled reason lived in a `title` — a tooltip needs a mouse, a hover, and a
 * guess that there is anything to hover. So the two claims here are that the
 * reason is ON SCREEN, and that a refusal from the shell lands on the row it
 * was about rather than scrolling off the top of an eight-row list.
 *
 * AND WHAT THE ROW REFUSES IS NOW ONLY THE DEFAULT (#476). A profile projects
 * are assigned to is deletable, and they fall back to the default with it — so
 * the claim that moved here is the confirm's, which is the one place that
 * consequence is stated before it happens.
 *
 * A DOM, because both claims are about what a reader sees after a press. The
 * registrar is handed back in `afterAll` the way `browser-profile-marks.test.tsx`
 * does it — this suite shares a process with tests written for a world that has
 * no `window`.
