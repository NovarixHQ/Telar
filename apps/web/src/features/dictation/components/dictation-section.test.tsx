/**
 * THE DICTATION PANE (#544) — its own tab, off by default.
 *
 * Two claims, and each of them is one somebody would otherwise find out the
 * hard way:
 *
 *   - SEARCH FINDS IT BY THE WORDS SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TYPES. It ships OFF, so
 *     the commonest question is "why is there no mic button" — asked as
 *     "dictation", "microphone", or "voice" — and all three have to land on the
 *     row that turns it on rather than on a key row for a provider nobody has
 *     chosen.
 *   - THE KEY ROW IS NOT THERE WHILE IT IS OFF, because asking for a credential
 *     nothing will spend is asking "which key" before "whose".
 *
 * AND SINCE #560, THE LANGUAGE ROW — Automatic by default, under the provider
 * and absent with it, drawn from the names the engine sends rather than from a
 * table copied into this app.
