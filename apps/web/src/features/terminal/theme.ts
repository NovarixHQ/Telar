/**
 * WHAT THE APP CONTRIBUTES TO A TERMINAL, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
 * (#198).
 *
 * FOUR COLOURS AND A FONT: background, foreground, cursor and its accent, plus
 * the selection wash. THE SIXTEEN ANSI COLOURS ARE NOT OURS. They are the
 * emulator's, exactly as they are in every desktop terminal where the app
 * chrome and the terminal palette are separate things — and exactly as they are
 * in T3 Code, which renders nvim correctly and contributes background,
 * foreground, cursor and selection and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A CHANGE. This module used to restate xterm.js's sixteen as
 * constants "so the theme is one readable object". A hand-copied table is a
 * table that drifts: the owner opened nvim and the palette was wrong, because
 * the copy is what every ANSI-colouring program (his prompt, `ls`, a
 * statusline) painted with. Omitting a key is not a gap — xterm.js fills each
 * of the sixteen from its own `DEFAULT_ANSI_COLORS` when the theme object does
 * not carry it (`ThemeService._setTheme`: `ansi = DEFAULT_ANSI_COLORS.slice()`,
 * then `ansi[n] = v(theme.black, DEFAULT_ANSI_COLORS[n])`, where `v` returns
 * its fallback for `undefined`). So the shortest correct table is no table.
 *
 * `overrides` still accepts ANSI keys, so a future appearance that genuinely carries
 * a palette can supply one without this module growing speculative
 * `--terminal-ansi-*` variables nobody has tested.
 *
 * AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE UNDER A LIGHT LOOK IS NOT OURS TO FIX. The owner's
 * `~/.zshrc` hardcodes `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE="fg=#666666"`, which is
 * very nearly invisible on a light background. That is correct behaviour: we
 * were asked for his colour and we drew his colour. No correction pass, no
 * injected shell config, no prompt wrapper.
