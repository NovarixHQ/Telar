/**
 * WHICH CHECKOUTS CAN GO — issue #671.
 *
 * Every claim here is a promise the surface has to keep, and each one is a way
 * the old behaviour or an obvious implementation gets it wrong:
 *
 *   IT NEVER OFFERS A LOCKED ROW AN AFFORDANCE. A checkout a session is working
 *   in must have no checkbox and no force field — git's lock does not refuse
 *   Telar, so a press would SUCCEED and take the directory an agent is writing
 *   in. The affordance's absence is the entire guard on this side.
 *
 *   IT NEVER DRAWS "NO CHECKOUTS" FOR AN ABSENT DRIVE. An empty list reads as
 *   "there are none", which is the reassuring lie the composer's count already
 *   knows not to tell.
 *
 *   IT SAYS "ARCHIVE" ON THE CONFIRM. Giving back a settled session's checkout
 *   ends that session; a confirm that named the gigabytes and hid the session
 *   is the kind people click and regret.
