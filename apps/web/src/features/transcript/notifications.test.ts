 * WHAT HAPPENED, DECIDED ONCE — issue #572.
 *
 * The table below is the whole point of the module: every kind crossed with
 * every intent, in one place, so a surface cannot answer differently. The bug
 * was a peer's `result` classified as a wake and titled "Session finished a
 * turn" beside the completion that actually was one.
