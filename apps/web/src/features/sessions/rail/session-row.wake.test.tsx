/**
 * THE DOT THAT SAYS A CONVERSATION WOKE — issues #490, #812, #816.
 *
 * THE VALUE IS NOT SET BY HAND HERE, and that is the whole point of the file.
 * A test that builds a `SidebarSession` with `wokeAt: 123` and asserts a dot
 * appears proves the component and nothing else — the wiring it is supposed to
 * be about (engine stamp → live row → `toSidebarSession` → markup) is exactly
 * the part it steps over. So every case below starts from a `LiveSessionRow`
 * PARSED BY THE PROTOCOL SCHEMA, the same shape `/v2/sessions/live` answers,
 * and goes through `toSidebarSession` on its way to the row.
 *
 * The other half of the seam — that the engine's sweep puts the same number on
 * the row and on the `session.woke` event — is asserted against a real sweep in
 * `apps/engine/test/snooze-wake.test.ts`. Between the two there is no step where
 * a person typed the timestamp.
