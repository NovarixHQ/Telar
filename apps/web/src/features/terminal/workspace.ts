/**
 * THE TERMINAL'S OWN TABS — the shells open inside one Terminal surface.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `right-panel-tabs.ts`, and it is the Editor's argument
 * (features/files/editor-workspace.ts) applied to a second surface. A shell used to be a
 * top-level panel tab: three of them wrote "Terminal", "Terminal", "Terminal"
 * across the strip and pushed Diff and Issues off the edge, so opening a second
 * shell cost you the surfaces you were working with. Shells are not surfaces.
 * They arrive in numbers, they are the thing every terminal emulator ever
 * written has given its own strip, and they belong INSIDE one Terminal.
 *
 * A PURE MODULE WITH NO EMULATOR IN IT, deliberately. What is hard about a
 * strip of shells is the bookkeeping — which one has focus after a close, which
 * PTY belongs to which chip, what survives a remount — and none of that needs a
 * document. The surface keeps what genuinely does: xterm, its addons, and the
 * bytes.
 *
 * THE PTY ID IS THE ONLY DURABLE THING HERE. A shell's `id` names the chip; its
 * `terminalId` names a process in the Electron host. The first is ours to mint,
 * the second is the host's to answer, and remembering the pair is what lets a
 * remounted Terminal re-adopt every running shell instead of stranding them and
 * opening a fresh set.
