/**
 * A DELEGATED CONVERSATION IS A SIBLING, NOT A CHILD — issue #381.
 *
 * The owner's complaint, verbatim: "It makes it feel like sub-agents when they
 * are really separate conversations." The rail drew a session somebody had
 * handed work to as an indented row behind an elbow (#324), under the row that
 * handed it over — a shape that says "this belongs to that", which is exactly
 * what a separate conversation with its own worktree and its own life does not.
 *
 * So the group draws what it holds, in the order it holds it, at one level.
 *
 * RENDERED RATHER THAN SCANNED. `sidebar-bands.test.ts` reads the rail's source
 * for the call sites that no longer exist; this asks the question a reader
 * asks — is the delegate on the same rail as everything else — of actual
 * markup, which is the only place an indent could still hide.
