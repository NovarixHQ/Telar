/**
 * A turn that cannot proceed, and a turn that has gone quiet — issue #813.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE TWO ARE IN ONE FILE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * They are the same question asked twice: can this engine tell the difference
 * between a session that is working and one that has stopped without saying so?
 * #813 recorded two occurrences and both attempts to answer it by hand were
 * wrong in opposite directions — a session whose `git worktree add` had been
 * killed read `working` for 45 minutes, and a healthy 80-minute turn was read
 * as wedged and stopped 837 ms after a successful `git push`.
 *
 * ── NOTHING HERE SPAWNS A PROVIDER, A WORKER OR A CLOCK ────────────────────
 * The store takes an injected clock, so "twenty-five minutes pass" is a
 * variable. `advance` below is the whole of the time machinery; there is no
 * sleeping, no real process and no wall-clock bound anywhere in this file.
 *
 * ── AND NOTHING ASSERTS ON A MESSAGE ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Every claim is a COUNT or a STATE. Both a failed cut and a resolved-model
 * failure produce git-shaped English, so a test that grepped the text would
 * pass on either. The one sentence that IS asserted is git's own, and it is
 * asserted by identity with what the fixture made git say.
