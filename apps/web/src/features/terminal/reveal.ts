/**
 * A TERMINAL THAT OPENS PUTS ITSELF IN THE PANEL — never the panel in front of
 * you ("Run = a new terminal", PR 5).
 *
 * An agent's `terminal_open`, or the person's own Run menu, each
 * open an engine terminal, and every one arrives on the session's run feed as a
 * new `RunView`. It used to get a chip only while the Terminal surface happened
 * to be MOUNTED: with the panel hidden, or showing the Diff, an agent could
 * start a dev server and nothing anywhere said so. Now the Terminal tab and the
 * terminal's chip exist whatever the panel is doing.
 *
 * THE ITEM, NEVER THE PANEL. This is `revealPanelTab`'s rule (#989) applied to
 * terminals: the tab is ADDED if missing and never selected, and `open` is
 * never touched. Which tab is active, and whether the panel shows at all, are
 * the person's alone. Nothing here focuses anything, so a person typing in the
 * composer or in another shell keeps their keyboard.
 *
 * NOR THE CHIP, ONE LEVEL DOWN. The terminal's chip joins the Terminal's inner
 * strip without becoming the active chip (`upsertRunShell` without `focus`).
 * THE ONE EXCEPTION IS AN EMPTY STRIP, and it is `upsertRunShell`'s existing
 * rule kept rather than a new one: a strip with no active chip gets the new chip
 * as its active one, because "no chip selected" is not a state the Terminal can
 * draw — the restore would pick the first chip anyway. That moves nobody's view:
 * the Terminal tab itself stays unselected.
 *
 * A PURE MODULE, so the rule is testable without a cockpit. The cockpit owns the
 * two guards that decide WHICH terminals count (`freshTerminals` below reads
 * them): only ones started after it mounted, and each only once.

 * on every reload, a Terminal tab the person had closed. `seen` keeps one
 * terminal from acting twice as its frames keep arriving — its `ready`, its
 * exit, the person closing it — so a chip somebody closed is not re-added by
 * the frame that reports the close.
