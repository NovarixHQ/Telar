/**
 * THE "+" CHOOSER OPENS ON A MOUSE CLICK (#349).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE HAS A DOM AND THE STRIP'S OTHER TESTS DO NOT. Everything else
 * about this strip is a fold you can render to a string — a label, a count, a
 * suffix — and `right-panel.render.test.tsx` pins those with
 * `renderToStaticMarkup`. A press is not one of those: the defect was that the
 * menu's open never survived the release, and nothing short of dispatching the
 * four events a browser dispatches can say whether it does. So this one file
 * registers a DOM, mounts the panel, and clicks.
 *
 * THE FRAME IS THE POINT. A menu trigger toggles from `mousedown` but defers
 * the state change to a `requestAnimationFrame`; in the packaged shell that
 * frame did not arrive and the press was swallowed, while the keyboard — which
 * opens synchronously from `click` — still worked. Every claim here is
 * therefore made twice: once with frames, once with the frame taken away.
 *
 * The DOM is registered for this file and handed back in `afterAll`, because
 * the suite shares one process and its neighbours are written for a world with
 * no `window` in it. That is late for one thing only — the primitives freeze
 * whether they have layout effects at their first import — and the preload
 * (scripts/test-dom.mjs) settles that before any test file loads.
