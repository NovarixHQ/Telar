/**
 * THE NOTIFICATION ROW — issue #550's visual half.
 *
 * A peer's message, a wake and a parked request all reached this session
 * without anybody typing, and all three used to be drawn as somebody's bubble:
 * the person's for a wake that landed mid-turn, an agent's dashed card for a
 * peer's. The row under test is neither. What these pin is that it says what
 * happened, that it does not quote a body it only announced, and that the body
 * is one press away when there IS one on this side.
