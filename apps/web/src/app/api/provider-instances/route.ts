/**
 * The configured logins — Telar's account registry.
 *
 * THE LIST AND ITS PROBE ARRIVE TOGETHER, in one call, because a settings row
 * needs both to render at all. Two round trips would let the page paint a green
 * dot beside an instance the second call is about to report missing.
 *
 * `?refresh=1` IS THE ONLY WAY PAST THE VERSION CACHE, and the surface sends it
 * only from a button a human pressed — the same rule the GitHub reads follow.
 * Probing costs a subprocess per driver, which is fine for a gesture and wrong
 * for a repaint.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SIGNS ANYONE IN and no route ever will: an instance names a
 * folder the user has already authenticated with their own CLI. Sensitive
 * environment values never come back — the engine redacts them on this read,
 * which is why the whole record can be handed to a browser.
